An application for motivating people to exercise by incentivizing them with the two true incentives in life: pride and money.

## Technology Stack

* MongoDB with Mongoose
* Node with Express
* Angular

## Setup (Please follow in order)

* Git clone the repo
* Checkout the dev branch
* Make sure you are in the root folder of the eggercise directory, which is 'eggercise'.
* Install npm if you haven't. Follow instrucions [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)
* Install MongoDB, Follow instructions [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb)
* npm install
* bower install
* Navigate to the /eggercise/server folder and run `jasmine init` (this is for setting up server side specs)
* Navigate to the /eggercise folder and run `gulp serve`

At this point, you should have the app setup complete.

#### Running the App

* Open a new terminal window and run the command 'mongod'.
* You should now see that Mongo server is running

* Open another terminal window and run the command 'gulp serve' to have the server running.
* With default settings, the app should automatically pop up in a new web browser window.
* (Skip this if previous step was successful) If not, open a new web browser window and in the URL bar, type in 'localhost:3000'. This should redirect you to the landing page of the app.
* You should see the landing page as shown below:

#### Tests for MongoDB and AngularJS

###### Running MongoDB Tests (Server Side)

* Open a new terminal window, and navigate to 'server' folder.
* There are 6 spec folders, one each for user, group, invite, auth, email, and error.
* In order to run the specs, run the command 'NODE_ENV=test jasmine spec/_path_to_directory/filename'.
* There is a total of 6 specs (including controllers and models) in the server side. You can run one spec file at a time. For example, if you want to run the spec for group controller, you would type in the command: 'NODE_ENV=test jasmine spec/api/group/group.controller.spec.js'
* This will run the test suite within the test database named 'eggercise-test'.

***WARNING: You cannot run the specs while the actual server is running. Terminate the server to run the spec files (Ctrl + C if server is running)

###### Running Angular Test (Client Side)

* Open a new terminal window, and navigate to 'client' folder.
* Simply run the command 'gulp test' in the terminal.
